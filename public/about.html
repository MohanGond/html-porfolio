  engineering I started to watch diferent movies of different languages along
  with my studies. Finally engineering completed with short amount of time as

  evryone wanted to do and spent around 4 years in there, my passion about work
  make me to swicth different company like HCL. But do you know how many day's I
  spent in HCL?? Ha ha!! It's only 3 months. Afterwords I switched to Cognizant

  watching movies that relievs me from stress and get into some emotion. I would
  like to play some sports whenever I got some time. Also, I'm willing to hear
  some songs that makes me feel better and energized. But I'm still passion
  about my work and wanted to grow prffessionally and personally. That's all
